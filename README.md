In Laravel, the web.php and api.php files are used for defining routes for web and API requests respectively.

The reason for having separate files for web and API routes is that they have different requirements and behaviors.

Web routes typically handle requests that are made by web browsers, such as GET and POST requests for loading web pages, submitting forms, and interacting with HTML content. These requests are typically expected to return HTML views or redirect to other pages.

API routes, on the other hand, typically handle requests that are made by other applications or services, such as mobile apps, web services, or other APIs. These requests are usually made in JSON format and are expected to return JSON responses. Additionally, APIs often require authentication and rate limiting, which are not typically required for web routes.

By having separate files for web and API routes, Laravel allows developers to define different behaviors and requirements for each type of request. The api.php file includes middleware that applies to all API routes, such as authentication and rate limiting. Additionally, the api.php file includes a prefix for all API routes, which makes it easier to distinguish between web and API routes when defining them.
